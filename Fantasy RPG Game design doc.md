  - Class progression:

In these tables the following conventions are used, but always use the class table if there is a conflict.

1. **Hit/Damage Bonus:**  
    – For Warriors, Wizards, and Archers (“Group A”), a bonus is earned when a character reaches levels 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, and 20. In other words, a character has no bonus at levels 1–2, gains +1 at level 3 (and holds that bonus through level 5), then +2 at level 6, etc.  
    – For Priests, Spell Blades, and Thieves (“Group B”), the bonus is given at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
2. **Spell Points:**  
    – Wizards and Priests start with 4 spell points at level 1 and gain one per level (so 4 at level 1, 5 at level 2, …, 23 at level 20).  
    – Spell Blades start with 2 spell points at level 1 and gain an extra spell point at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, and 20.
3. **Hit Points (HP):**  
    – Warriors use a d10 per level, Priests (and (here assumed) Spell Blades) use d8, Archers and Thieves use d6, and Wizards use d4.
4. **Armor Class (AC) Bonus:**  
    – **Warriors:** “Start at +1” and then “+1 every other level” (using your examples: AC +1 at level 1, +2 at level 3, +3 at level 5, +4 at level 6, etc.).  
    – **Thieves:** Start at +1 at level 1 and gain an extra point every 3 levels (AC +1 at level 1, +2 at level 4, +3 at level 7, +4 at level 10, +5 at level 13, +6 at level 16, +7 at level 19, with level 20 remaining +7).  
    – **Priests & Archers:** Start at +0 and gain +1 every 3 levels (AC 0 at levels 1–3, +1 at levels 4–6, +2 at levels 7–9, +3 at levels 10–12, +4 at levels 13–15, and +5 at levels 16–18, with +6 at level 19–20 for Priests if you wish).  
    – **Mages, Summoners & Spell Blades:** Start at +0 and gain +1 every 4 levels (AC 0 at levels 1–4, then +2 at levels 5–8, +3 at levels 9–12, +4 at levels 13–17, and +5 at levels 18–20).

**1\. Warrior (Melee)**

_(Group A for attack bonus; uses d10 for HP; AC bonus “every other level”.)_

| Level | Hit/Dmg Bonus | Base AC | HP Die | Attacks per round |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 19  | 7   | 10  | d10 | 4   |
| 20  | 8   | 10  | d10 | 4   |

_Note:_ The “+” to hit and damage reflects a cumulative bonus that increases at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, and 20. Fighters can wear any armor.

**2\. Wizard (Magic)**

_(No attack bonus; uses d4 for HP; Wizards are “mages” so follow the mage AC progression; also get spell points.)_

| Level | Resist Magic % | Spell Points | AC Bonus | HP Die |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | \-  | 4   | 0   | d4  |
| 2   | \-  | 5   | 0   | d4  |
| 3   | 5%  | 6   | 0   | d4  |

| 11  | 15% | 14  | 3   | d4  |
| 12  | 15% | 15  | 3   | d4  |
| 13  | 20% | 16  | 4   | d4  |
| 14  | 20% | 17  | 4   | d4  |
| 15  | 20% | 18  | 4   | d4  |
| 16  | 20% | 19  | 4   | d4  |
| 17  | 25% | 20  | 4   | d4  |
| 18  | 25% | 21  | 5   | d4  |
| 19  | 35% | 22  | 5   | d4  |
| 20  | 40% | 23  | 5   | d4  |

_Note:_ Wizards get a resist magic bonus as they level.

**3\. Archer (Ranged)**

_(Group A for attack bonus; uses d6 for HP; AC bonus is as specified for archers/priests.)_

| Level | Hit/Dmg Bonus | AC Bonus | HP Die | Attacks per round | detect secret doors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | d6  | 1   | 5%  |
| 2   | 0   | 0   | d6  | 1   | 5%  |
| 3   | 1   | 0   | d6  | 1   | 10% |
| 4   | 1   | 1   | d6  | 1   | 10% |
| 5   | 1   | 1   | d6  | 1   | 10% |
| 6   | 2   | 1   | d6  | 1   | 20% |
| 7   | 2   | 2   | d6  | 1   | 20% |
| 8   | 2   | 2   | d6  | 1   | 20% |
| 9   | 3   | 2   | d6  | 2   | 30% |
| 10  | 3   | 3   | d6  | 2   | 30% |
| 11  | 3   | 3   | d6  | 2   | 30% |
| 12  | 4   | 3   | d6  | 2   | 40% |
| 13  | 4   | 4   | d6  | 2   | 40% |
| 14  | 4   | 4   | d6  | 2   | 40% |
| 15  | 5   | 4   | d6  | 3   | 50% |
| 16  | 5   | 5   | d6  | 3   | 50% |
| 17  | 5   | 5   | d6  | 3   | 50% |
| 18  | 6   | 5   | d6  | 3   | 50% |
| 19  | 7   | 6   | d6  | 4   | 50% |
| 20  | 8   | 6   | d6  | 4   | 50% |

_Note:_ Archers also use the door/secret–detection mechanism (for halflings/archers) with the chance per level plus 5% per ability modifiers, so for example a 6<sup>th</sup> level archer with a 14 Dex can detect traps at the base of 20% + 5% (from the dex modifier). only Thieves get the extra “bonus” ticks for locks. Also, Archers can only wear light armor.

**4\. Priest**

_(Group B for attack bonus; uses d8 for HP; AC follows the priests/archers progression; gets spell points.)_

| Level | Hit/Dmg Bonus | Spell Points | Base AC | HP Die | Divine Call |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 0   | 4   | 0   | d8  | 1   |
| 2   | 0   | 5   | 0   | d8  | 1   |
| 3   | 0   | 6   | 0   | d8  | 1   |
| 4   | 1   | 7   | 1   | d8  | 1   |
| 5   | 1   | 8   | 1   | d8  | 1   |
| 6   | 1   | 9   | 1   | d8  | 1   |
| 7   | 1   | 10  | 2   | d8  | 1   |
| 8   | 2   | 11  | 2   | d8  | 2   |
| 9   | 2   | 12  | 2   | d8  | 2   |
| 10  | 2   | 13  | 3   | d8  | 2   |
| 11  | 2   | 14  | 3   | d8  | 2   |
| 12  | 3   | 15  | 3   | d8  | 2   |
| 13  | 3   | 16  | 4   | d8  | 2   |
| 14  | 3   | 17  | 4   | d8  | 2   |
| 15  | 3   | 18  | 4   | d8  | 3   |
| 16  | 4   | 19  | 5   | d8  | 3   |
| 17  | 4   | 20  | 5   | d8  | 3   |
| 18  | 4   | 21  | 5   | d8  | 3   |
| 19  | 4   | 22  | 6   | d8  | 3   |
| 20  | 5   | 23  | 6   | d8  | 4   |

_Note:_ For door/chest opening, Priests are not given the extra bonus ticks (only Wizards and Thieves do). Priests may use “Divine Call” per rest as indicated in the table.

**5\. Spell Blade**

_(Group B for hit bonus; uses d8 for HP; follows mage–type AC progression; has a unique spell–point progression.)_

| Level | Hit/Dmg Bonus | Spell Points | AC Bonus | HP Die |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 0   | 2   | 0   | d8  |
| 2   | 0   | 2   | 0   | d8  |
| 3   | 0   | 3   | 0   | d8  |
| 4   | 1   | 3   | 0   | d8  |
| 5   | 1   | 3   | 2   | d8  |
| 6   | 1   | 4   | 2   | d8  |
| 7   | 1   | 4   | 2   | d8  |
| 8   | 2   | 4   | 2   | d8  |
| 9   | 2   | 5   | 3   | d8  |
| 10  | 2   | 5   | 3   | d8  |
| 11  | 2   | 5   | 3   | d8  |
| 12  | 3   | 6   | 3   | d8  |
| 13  | 3   | 6   | 4   | d8  |
| 14  | 3   | 6   | 4   | d8  |
| 15  | 3   | 7   | 4   | d8  |
| 16  | 4   | 7   | 4   | d8  |
| 17  | 4   | 7   | 4   | d8  |
| 18  | 4   | 8   | 5   | d8  |
| 19  | 4   | 9   | 5   | d8  |
| 20  | 5   | 10  | 5   | d8  |

_Note:_ The spell–point progression for Spell Blades is “lumpy” (gaining extra points only at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, and 20) while their hit/dmg bonus follows the Group B schedule.

**6\. Thief**

_(Group B for attack bonus; uses d6 for HP; AC bonus “every 3 levels” as described; Thieves also get the special door/chest bonus using the Group A ticks for that ability.)_

| Level | Hit/Dmg Bonus | AC Bonus | HP Die | Open locks, detect secret doors & traps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | d6  | 5%  |
| 2   | 0   | 1   | d6  | 5%  |
| 3   | 0   | 1   | d6  | 10% |
| 4   | 1   | 2   | d6  | 10% |
| 5   | 1   | 2   | d6  | 10% |
| 6   | 1   | 2   | d6  | 20% |
| 7   | 1   | 3   | d6  | 20% |
| 8   | 2   | 3   | d6  | 20% |
| 9   | 2   | 3   | d6  | 30% |
| 10  | 2   | 4   | d6  | 30% |
| 11  | 2   | 4   | d6  | 30% |
| 12  | 3   | 4   | d6  | 40% |
| 13  | 3   | 5   | d6  | 40% |
| 14  | 3   | 5   | d6  | 40% |
| 15  | 3   | 5   | d6  | 50% |
| 16  | 4   | 6   | d6  | 50% |
| 17  | 4   | 6   | d6  | 50% |
| 18  | 4   | 6   | d6  | 60% |
| 19  | 4   | 7   | d6  | 70% |
| 20  | 5   | 7   | d6  | 80% |

_Note:_  Thieves detect secret doors, traps, and can open locked–door/chest using the indicated base chance plus 5% per ability bonus from dexterity. So a 3<sup>rd</sup> level thief with 16 Dexterity would add +10% from ability plus the level–based 10%, for 20% total.

**Magic System Overview**

**Spell Levels**

- **5 Spell Levels**: Matching your monster CR range of 1-5
- **Character Levels 1-20**: Gradual progression through these spell levels

**Character Progression**

| **Character Level** | **Max Spell Level** |
| --- | --- |
| 1-3 | 1   |
| 4-7 | 2   |
| 8-11 | 3   |
| 12-15 | 4   |
| 16-20 | 5   |

**Spell Points**

- Base formula: base_points + (level × class_multiplier × 3)
- Different starting values and multipliers per class:
  - Wizard: 4 base, 1.0 multiplier (highest)
  - Priest: 3 base, 0.8 multiplier (medium)
  - Spellblade: 2 base, 0.5 multiplier (lowest)

**Spell Cost**

- Simple formula: spell_level × 2 + 1
  - Level 1 spell: 3 points
  - Level 2 spell: 5 points
  - Level 3 spell: 7 points
  - Level 4 spell: 9 points
  - Level 5 spell: 11 points

**Class Focus**

- **Wizard**: Offensive magic, utility, battlefield control
- **Priest**: Healing, buffs, undead control, divine protection
- **Spellblade**: Self-buffs, weapon enhancements, limited offensive

**Spell Effects**

- Direct damage (various damage types)
- Area effects
- Healing and curing
- Buffs and debuffs
- Utility (light, unlocking, detection)
- Condition application (poison, paralysis, etc.)

**Spell Scaling**

- Damage increases with spell level (~2d6 per level)
- Duration increases with spell level
- Range increases with spell level
- Higher-level spells affect more targets or larger areas

This system provides a balanced progression that aligns with your CR 1-5 monster range across 20 character levels, with appropriate resource management and class differentiation.
